## Whack-A-Mole

Developed a version of the infamous Whack-A-Mole game as a web application. I was inspired by Wes Bos's Javascript30 whack-a-mole game and decided to recreate my own version. Once a player presses the start button a mole pops up from a random hole and stays visible for a random amount of time, in which the player must click ("whack") in order to score a point. Each round of play lasts 10 seconds.
